Fully automatic time tracking for Eclipse.

Installation
------------

Heads Up! WakaTime depends on [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/) being installed to work correctly.

1. Download the [plugin](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wakatime.com/eclipse/).

  a) Press `ctrl+shift+p`(Windows, Linux) or `cmd+shift+p`(OS X).

  b) Type `install`, then press `enter` with `Package Control: Install Package` selected.

  c) Type `wakatime`, then press `enter` with the `WakaTime` plugin selected.

3. You will see a prompt at the bottom asking for your [api key](https://wakatime.com/#apikey). Enter your api key, then press `enter`.

4. Use Sublime and your time will automatically be tracked for you.

5. Visit https://wakatime.com to see your logged time.

6. Consider installing [BIND9](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto#Caching_Server_configuration) to cache your repeated DNS requests: `sudo apt-get install bind9`
